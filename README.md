Cobalt
---

Cobalt is an alternative **UNOFFICIAL** Steam frontend for mobile devices. Powered by [kSteam](https://github.com/iTaysonLab/kSteam), Cobalt allows users to do more than the official application provides.

> Like kSteam, Cobalt is in very early state, so expect bugs and incomplete features. 

> Cobalt is not endorsed, sponsored, approved, developed by Valve Corporation or related to it. All trademarks are registered and protected properties of respective owners.

- Don't _feel_ like a native app, but actually _be_ a native app
- Use latest technology available to create beautiful yet highly responsive interfaces
- Enhance user experience by providing a easy way to interact with complex social infrastructure of Steam
